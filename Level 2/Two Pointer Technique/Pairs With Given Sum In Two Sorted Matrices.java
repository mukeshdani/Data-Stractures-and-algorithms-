/*1. You are given a number N and two sorted matrices(A and B) of N*N dimensions.
2. You are also given a number X.
3. You have to find the count of all valid pairs from matrices whose sum is equal to X.
4. A pair is called valid if one element of the pair is selected from A and the second element is selected from B.
Input Format
A number N
A1
A2.. N*N numbers
B1
B2.. N*N numbers
Output Format
A number representing the count of all valid pairs.*/
