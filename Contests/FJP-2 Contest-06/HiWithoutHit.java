/*1.Take as input String.
2.Take as input Integer "i" which I used to verify your return type String.

a. Write a recursive function which counts the number of times ‘hi’ appears in
   the string – but skip all such ‘hi’ which are followed by ‘t’ to form ‘hit’.
   Print the value returned.
b. Write a recursive function which removes all ‘hi’ in the string – but skip
   all such ‘hi’ which are followed by ‘t’ to form ‘hit’. Print the i'th index
   character from the returned value.
c. Write a recursive function which removes all ‘hi’ in the string – but skip
   all such ‘hi’ which are followed by ‘t’ to form ‘hit’. Print the
   output (return type void).
