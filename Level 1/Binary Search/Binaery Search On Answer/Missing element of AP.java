//Missing element of AP




































/*Find the missing element from an ordered array arr[], consisting of N elements representing an Arithmetic Progression(AP).

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Arr[] = {2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14}
Output: 6
Explanation: Actual AP should be 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 6
Arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 31}
Output: 26
Explanation: Actual AP should be 
1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMissing() which takes the array of integers arr[] and its size n as input parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
2 <= N <= 105
0 <= |Arr[i]| <= 107
There will always be only one missing element.*/
